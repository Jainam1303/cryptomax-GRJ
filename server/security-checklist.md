## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

1. **NEVER store passwords in plain text**
2. **ALWAYS validate inputs on server-side**
3. **NEVER trust client-side validation**
4. **ALWAYS use HTTPS in production**
5. **NEVER expose sensitive data in logs**
6. **ALWAYS implement proper error handling**
7. **NEVER use default credentials**
8. **ALWAYS keep dependencies updated**

## ðŸ“‹ IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

### HIGH PRIORITY (Implement First)
1. Server-side input validation
2. Password hashing with bcrypt
3. HTTPS enforcement
4. Security headers
5. Rate limiting middleware

### MEDIUM PRIORITY
1. File upload security
2. Database security
3. Monitoring and logging
4. Two-factor authentication

### LOW PRIORITY
1. Advanced monitoring
2. Compliance documentation
3. Advanced security features
